//! Gaze estimation, and the eye-in-head signal (build step 6b).
//!
//! `mobileone_s0_gaze.onnx` from `yakhyo/gaze-estimation` (MIT). `detect-cli
//! inspect` reports:
//!
//! ```text
//! input   Float32  [1, 3, 448, 448]
//! yaw     Float32  [1, 90]
//! pitch   Float32  [1, 90]
//! ```
//!
//! Those are **90-bin classification heads, not regressed angles** — the
//! L2CS-Net scheme this model inherits. Decode is softmax over the bins, then
//! the expectation over bin centres.
//!
//! The bin geometry is read from the author's own postprocess, not assumed:
//! `bins = 90`, `binwidth = 4`, `angle_offset = 180`, so
//!
//! ```text
//! degrees = sum(softmax(logits) * [0..89]) * 4 - 180
//! ```
//!
//! which spans **-180..+176 degrees**, a Gaze360-style full range. Assuming the
//! MPIIGaze-style +/-90 span would have halved every angle — a signal that
//! still moves in the right direction, still looks alive in a HUD, and
//! quietly wrecks every threshold tuned against it.
//!
//! Preprocessing matches the head-pose model: RGB (the reference converts from
//! OpenCV's BGR, ours is already RGB), /255, then ImageNet mean/std.
